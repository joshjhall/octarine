# Refactor Status

> **Status:** Complete as of v0.3.0-beta.1.

> The refactor described on this page delivered octarine's three-layer
> architecture, unified observability, and the orthogonal
> data/security/identifiers split. This page is retained as a summary of

## Overview

Octarine's v0.3.0 refactor rebuilt the crate around a three-layer
architecture that prevents circular dependencies and separates concerns
cleanly:

```text
Layer 1: primitives/    (pub(crate))  Pure functions, no observe dependency
            ↓
Layer 2: observe/       (pub)         Observability; uses primitives only
            ↓
Layer 3: data/, security/, identifiers/, runtime/,
         crypto/, io/, auth/, http/   (pub)   Uses primitives + observe
```

Layer 1 is further split into three orthogonal concerns that answer
distinct questions:

| Concern | Purpose | Question |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `data/` | FORMAT | "How should this be structured?" |
| `security/` | THREATS | "Is this dangerous?" |
| `identifiers/` | CLASSIFICATION | "What is it? Is it PII?" |

## Objectives (all delivered)

### Clean API

- No backward-compatibility layers
- Consistent naming conventions (prefix indicates return type)
- Builder + shortcut pattern across every Layer 3 module

### Three-layer architecture

- Layer 1 primitives are `pub(crate)` — pure, observe-free
- Layer 2 observe depends only on primitives
- Layer 3 wraps primitives with automatic instrumentation

### Unified observability

- Automatic WHO/WHAT/WHEN/WHERE context capture
- 30+ PII types detected and redacted
- SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR, PCI-DSS compliance mappings
- Multi-writer output (console, file/JSONL, SQLite, PostgreSQL)

### Orthogonal concerns

- Each domain (paths, network, text) can have FORMAT + THREATS +
  CLASSIFICATION modules independently
